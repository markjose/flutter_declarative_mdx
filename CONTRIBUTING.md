# Contributing to flutter_declarative_mdx

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This project aims to stay small, composable, and easy to reason about. Contributions that improve clarity, extensibility, and real-world usability are especially welcome.

## Ways to contribute

You can help by:

* Reporting bugs
* Suggesting improvements
* Improving documentation
* Adding or refining components
* Providing real-world usage feedback
* Submitting pull requests

If you’re unsure whether something fits the project, open an issue first and start a discussion.

## Before you start

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue to discuss:

* The problem being solved
* Proposed approach
* Any alternative options considered

This helps avoid duplicated work and keeps the library coherent.

## Development setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a feature branch from `main`

```
git checkout -b feature/your-change
```

4. Make your changes
5. Run analysis/tests if present
6. Commit and push
7. Open a pull request

## Pull request guidelines

Please keep PRs:

**Small and focused**
Avoid mixing multiple unrelated changes.

**Well described**
Explain:

* What changed
* Why it changed
* Any tradeoffs or design decisions

**Consistent with project style**
Match existing naming, structure, and patterns where possible.

**Documented**
Update README or inline docs if behaviour changes or new features are added.

## Design principles

When contributing, try to align with these goals:

* Keep the core lightweight
* Prefer composition over complexity
* Avoid over-engineering
* Optimise for readability and predictability
* Maintain extensibility for real-world apps

This library is intentionally pragmatic rather than theoretical.

## Breaking changes

If a change introduces breaking behaviour:

* Clearly explain why it’s necessary
* Document migration where possible
* Keep surface area minimal

## Issues

When raising issues, please include:

* What you expected to happen
* What actually happened
* Steps to reproduce (if relevant)
* Flutter version (if relevant)
* Example MDX snippet (if applicable)

Clear issues get resolved faster.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.
This project aims to be a calm, professional space for collaboration.

## Questions

If something is unclear:

* Open an issue
* Start a discussion
* Or submit a draft PR
