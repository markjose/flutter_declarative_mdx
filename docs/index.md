# flutter_declarative_mdx

**Declarative server-driven UI for Flutter using extensible Markdown**

This project explores a simple approach to defining common application UI — documents, forms, and workflows — using structured markdown delivered from a server and rendered natively in Flutter.

## Documentation

* [Vision](vision.md)
* Architecture *(coming soon)*
* Example usage *(coming soon)*

## What this project is

A lightweight library for rendering MDX into native Flutter UI, with support for:

* Structured documents
* Forms and data capture
* Step-based workflows
* Server-driven pages
* Custom components

Documents are defined server-side.
Flutter renders them using native widgets.

## Status

This project is early and evolving.
APIs and patterns may change as real-world usage informs design.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
