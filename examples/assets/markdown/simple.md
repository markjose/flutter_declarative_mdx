# Example Content

This content is loaded from a local Flutter asset file inside the example application.

It demonstrates how standard Markdown can be bundled with the app and rendered using `flutter_declarative_mdx`.

## About this example

The Markdown for this page lives in the example app's assets folder and is loaded at runtime.

This shows how the same rendering system can support:

- Local bundled content
- Remote server-delivered content
- Or a combination of both

The rendering pipeline remains identical regardless of where the content comes from.

## Why use asset-based Markdown?

Bundling Markdown with the app is useful when:

- You want predictable example content
- The app needs offline documentation
- You are building prototypes or demos
- Content rarely changes
- You want fallback content if the server is unavailable
